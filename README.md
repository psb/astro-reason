# Astro with a sprinkle of Reason

This is a basic project that shows you how you can mix [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) with [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/en) and [Reason React](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en). The project uses [Melange](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/) to transform the Reason code to JS.

> Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
>
> There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
>
> Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Reason React components are also placed in the components folder (along with their interface files). The `dune` file in the components folder tells Dune how to process the components and output JS.

The `_build` directory is where the output JS is placed.

The `<project_name>.opam` file contains the Reason/OCaml packages required and `package.json` contains the JS packages required.

The `dune` file at the root of the project is used to tell Dune how to use any Reason/OCaml packages installed from npm.

The `dune-project` file describes the project.

The `Makefile` contains the commands for the project.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

Commands for developing and building the project are found in the Makefile. The setup is very similar to running commands found in a package.json file.

You can see all available commands by running `make help` or just `make`. Here
are a few of the most useful ones:

- `make init`: set up opam local switch and download OCaml, Melange and
  JavaScript dependencies
- `make install`: install OCaml, Melange and JavaScript dependencies
- `make watch`: watch for the filesystem and have Melange rebuild on every
  change
- `make dev`: serve the JS application with a local HTTP server
- `make bundle`: bundles the JS into the `dist` folder
- `make preview`: serve the bundled JS application with a local HTTP server

### Setup

After [getting up and running with OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running), run:

```sh
make init
```

This will setup the project and install the packages.

### Development

```sh
# in one terminal run:
make watch

# in another terminal run:
make dev
```
